   - PWA capabilities
   - Advanced analytics

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Backend (ICP)
```
Internet Computer Network
├── user_management (User registration, profiles, verification status)
├── credential_nft (Credential creation, ownership, metadata)
├── verification (Verification requests, approvals, rejections)
├── storage (Document storage, file management)
└── internet_identity (Authentication and identity management)
```

### Frontend (Next.js)
```
Next.js Application
├── Authentication Context (Internet Identity integration)
├── ICP Hooks (useUserManagement, useCredentialNft, etc.)
├── Error Boundaries (ICErrorBoundary, NetworkStatus)
├── Loading States (Skeleton screens, spinners)

## 🎉 Conclusion

The dresumeV2 project has made significant progress with a robust backend infrastructure on the Internet Computer and a well-architected frontend with comprehensive error handling. The main remaining task is to resolve the development server issues and complete the end-to-end integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

The project is well-positioned for production deployment once the integration testing is completed and any remaining issues are resolved.
