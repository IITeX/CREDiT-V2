### 2. **AI Verification Logic**
- **First Attempt**: Simulates failure with "Document uploaded is not a valid document" error
- **Second Attempt**: Simulates success with document verification
- **User Flow**:
  1. User uploads documents
  2. Clicks "Submit Application" 
  3. First attempt fails with error message
  4. User clicks "Retry Submission"
  5. Second attempt succeeds and proceeds to success page

### 3. **UI Improvements**
- Real-time verification status display
- Loading states during AI processing
- Success/error feedback cards
- Dynamic button text based on attempt number
- Progress indicators for verification steps

## üîß Technical Fixes
