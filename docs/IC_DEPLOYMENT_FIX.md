# IC Network Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem Summary

You successfully created canister IDs on the IC network, but the WASM modules weren't properly deployed, causing the "IC0537: Requested canister has no wasm module" error.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Code Issues Fixed ✅
- **Added `getName()` function** to both `credential_nft` and `storage` canisters
- **Added `getStats()` function** to `credential_nft` canister for monitoring
- **Added Candid metadata configuration** to `dfx.json` to resolve warnings

### 2. Configuration Updates ✅
- **Updated `dfx.json`** with proper metadata configuration
- **Created deployment fix script** to install WASM modules to existing canisters

## Your Current Canister IDs

```
CREDENTIAL_NFT_CANISTER_ID = "k7fau-4yaaa-aaaao-qkb2a-cai"
STORAGE_CANISTER_ID = "kyega-raaaa-aaaao-qkb2q-cai"
```

## How to Fix the Deployment

### Step 1: Run the Fix Script

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd /path/to/dresumeV2

# Run the deployment fix script
./scripts/fix-ic-deployment.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build your canisters locally
2. Install the WASM modules to your existing canister IDs
3. Test the canister functionality
4. Generate TypeScript declarations
5. Update your environment configuration

### Step 2: Test the Canisters

```bash
# Test your canisters are working
./scripts/test-ic-canisters.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify in Browser

Visit the IC Dashboard to confirm your canisters are working:
- [Credential NFT Canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/k7fau-4yaaa-aaaao-qkb2a-cai)
- [Storage Canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/kyega-raaaa-aaaao-qkb2q-cai)

## Manual Commands (Alternative)

If the script doesn't work, you can run these commands manually:

```bash
# Build canisters
dfx build --network ic

# Install WASM modules to existing canisters
dfx canister --network ic install credential_nft --mode reinstall
dfx canister --network ic install storage --mode reinstall

# Test functionality
dfx canister --network ic call credential_nft getName
dfx canister --network ic call storage getName

# Generate declarations
dfx generate --network ic
```

## Environment Configuration

After running the fix script, your `.env.local` should look like:

```env
# Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_DFX_NETWORK="ic"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IC_HOST="https://ic0.app"

# Canister IDs (IC Network - DEPLOYED & WORKING)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDENTIAL_NFT_CANISTER_ID="k7fau-4yaaa-aaaao-qkb2a-cai"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_CANISTER_ID="kyega-raaaa-aaaao-qkb2q-cai"

# Internet Identity Canister (Production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_INTERNET_IDENTITY_CANISTER_ID="rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaah-qdrha-cai"
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "Access Denied" errors:
```bash
# Make sure you're using the correct identity
dfx identity whoami

# If needed, switch to the identity that owns the canisters
dfx identity use your-identity-name
```

### If installation fails:
```bash
# Try upgrade mode instead of reinstall
dfx canister --network ic install credential_nft --mode upgrade
dfx canister --network ic install storage --mode upgrade
```

### If you need to check canister status:
```bash
# Check canister info
dfx canister --network ic status credential_nft
dfx canister --network ic status storage
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test your frontend**: `npm run dev`
2. **Verify IC integration**: Your app should now connect to the IC network properly
3. **Test credential creation**: Try creating and searching for credentials
4. **Monitor canister usage**: Use the IC Dashboard to monitor your canisters

## Important Notes

- Your canister IDs are permanent and won't change
- The fix script preserves your existing data (if any)
- Make sure to commit your updated `.env.local` file
- Consider setting up monitoring for your production canisters

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the IC Dashboard for canister status
2. Verify your identity has the correct permissions
3. Ensure you have sufficient cycles for canister operations
4. Review the deployment logs for specific error messages
