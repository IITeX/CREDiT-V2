# CREDiT - Decentralized Professional Credentials Platform 📚

## 🌟 Overview

CREDiT is a revolutionary decentralized platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that enables users to create, verify, and manage professional credentials as Soul Bound Tokens (SBTs). Our platform provides a trustworthy, immutable, and globally accessible system for professional achievement verification with advanced role-based issuer capabilities.

## ‼️ Important Note
> Since there's an issue on integrating the ICP Internet Identity on our system, managing the users verification isn't possible as of now hence we've created these bypass routes for demo purposes of the functionality of our system if the user has been successfully verified.
> 
> If you want to explore the website use these bypass routes:
> 
> (e.g. https://credit.zaide.online/dashboard-direct)
> 
> - **Individual** - `/dashboard-direct`
> - **Issuer** - `/issuer-direct` and `/issuer-notification`
> - **Admin** - `/admin-direct`
